# Config API

The Config API allows you to manage your Commanders Act account, sources, destinations, and more programmatically. You may use the API to:

* Create new users and assign them to scoped roles
* Get data from any reports to build custom dashboard in Excel, Google Data Studio or any BI tools
* Create new Destinations - or delete them - with a few lines of code
* Configure, disable, or view Sources and manage connected Destinations
* Get a complete view of all the Sources and Destinations
* Query Event Delivery metrics to build custom dashboards and alerts to monitor delivery of your events to destinations
* etc.

The Config API is a set of REST services under api.commander1.com, you can download the [openAPI specification](https://tagcommander.github.io/api\_doc/) or read the [API documentation here](https://tagcommander.github.io/api\_doc/).&#x20;
