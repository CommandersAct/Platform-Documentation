# Customers

Part of our Data Activation module, Customers is the heart of our CDP (Customer Data Platform) offer. From multiple sources (online and offline), it allows reconciling and aggregating data around user profiles, to create accurate audience segments.&#x20;

By crossing any kind of data (CRM, online behavior on Web & Mobile, offline behavior in shops...), you can create highly accurate segments. More precise segments are, better is the personalization: these segments could be then sent to destinations, and, as a result, you can send a personalized message to a small audience who share same characteristics (in the same segment).&#x20;

Send the right message to the right audience is the key to improve the ROAS (Return On Ad Spent).
