# Enrichments

Data enrichment is the process of adding additional information to data sets in real-time in order to make them more valuable and useful.\
\
It can be used to [enrich events](events-enrichment.md) as well as [user profiles](augmented-user-attributes/). \
\
Real-time event enrichment involves adding contextual data to events as they occur (ex: weather information), while real-time user profile enrichment involves calculating new attributes about a user's characteristics, behavior, and preferences to their profile (using score, flags, ratio, rolling count/average, conditional value, boolean...). \
\
Both forms of enrichment can help businesses better understand and engage with their customers.\
Enrich incoming events in real-time before to send it to destinations.
