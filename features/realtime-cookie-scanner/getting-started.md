#### Step 2

Generate and deploy your Web Container(s)

You don't use our TMS? Then simply generate and deploy your privacy banner(s)

### Clients using a Didomi or OneTrust CMP:

Follow the Step 1 mentioned above (as our clients using our CMP).

Once your setting is declared on Cookie Notice UI, you simply need to generate and deploy your Web Container(s)

### Clients using another CMP brand

Our Real-time Cookie Scanner is compatible with any CMP. Please ask your sales representative for personalized setup instructions.
