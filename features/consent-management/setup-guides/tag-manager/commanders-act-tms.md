# Commanders Act TMS

Consent Module and TMS Commanders Act are natively integrated with each other. This setup requires minimal technical knowledge and can be done entirely in the interface.

## Setup

Following you will find the required steps to implement a standard Commanders Act Consent module setup.

1. Choose the default account configuration mode for your account (see [Options](../../user-guides/settings.md)).
2. Setup your Consent categories & vendors (see [Manage Categories](../../user-guides/categories-and-tags/manage-categories.md)).
3. Assign your Consent categories & vendors to your Commanders Act Web Container tags (see [Assign categories](../../user-guides/categories-and-tags/assign-categories.md))
4. Create one or multiple Consent banner templates (see [Manage Banner](../../user-guides/privacy-banners/manage-banner.md))
5. Deploy your Consent banner templates to the Commanders Act CDN or on premise target (see [Deploy Banner](../../user-guides/privacy-banners/deploy-banner.md)).
6. Connect your privacy banner templates with Commanders Act  Web Container and implement rules for which the banner should be played out (see below).

## Install Consent banner with TMS Commanders Act&#x20;

To deploy a Consent banner with the Commanders Act TMS it needs to be linked to a container.  Commanders Act TMS  can then be use to implement detailed rules for which a Consent banner is shown to visitors.

In  Commanders Act TMS  it is possible to provide exact conditions to decide when each of the linked privacy banners should be shown to visitors. Typical use cases consist of:

* Implement different banner for different languages or regions
* Avoid to deploy the banner on legal pages (privacy policy) so that users can read them before providing consent.
* Implement AB test for two banner designs.

You can create constrains under the `PRIVACY BANNERS` section to define under which conditions a privacy banner should be shown. Privacy banner constraint work the same way as tag constraints. Please reference constraints in the Web Container documentation for more information.

You have to first deploy a banner to the Commanders Act CDN or on premise location before being able to configure constraints (see [Deploy Banner](../../user-guides/privacy-banners/deploy-banner.md)).

Commanders Act TMS makes it easy to implement Consent banner on websites. To link a privacy banner with a Commanders Act TMS container it just has to be activated in the `GENERATE` tab with the `ACTIVATION` checkbox. This installs the selected privacy banner in the generated container version.
