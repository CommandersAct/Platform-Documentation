# Preference center

## What is our Marketing Preferences Center?

Marketing Preferences Center is part of our Consent management Premium offer. \
It allows you to build a personalized Preferences Center where online and offline consents are merged around unified users and stored in the same database.

Then, you can easily create and customize a web page to display this information to visitors who want to manage their consents and personal information.

It turns a legal page into a preference center that is way more valuable for a customer as it is more like a sharing space between the brand and their visitors/clients rather than just a way to collect the consent.

## How it works?



Marketing Preferences Center is a realtime searchable nosql database. We provide also a dedicated API to read and/or write preferences/consents on this database&#x20;

·      Consents are collected through our CMP solution (native integration)

·      Preferences coming from a CRM database could be added with the [FTP importer files](../sources/sources-catalog/import-crm-users/users-file-importer.md) or [API](../sources/sources-catalog/import-crm-users/api-users.md#user)&#x20;

·      Our customers can personalize the look and feel of their marketing preferences center page, we don’t host the webpage.

·      Paid option: our customers can choose to receive regularly a full consents database copy to have a backup on their side
