### Limitations

While CAA is a powerful tool, here are some current limitations to keep in mind:

* üåç **Consistent Web Container URLs:** The WebContainer URLs must remain the same across all pages for the plugin to function correctly.\

* ‚ö° **SPA Compatibility:** On **Single Page Applications (SPA)**, the list of triggered tags is only filled on the **first hit** collected by the plugin. On each page change, the tags are added to the list.\
  \*This will behavior will be improved in an upcoming update, so stay tuned!\
