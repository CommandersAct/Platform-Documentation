# Container

The browser-side **container** is a “box” containing all your partner solutions’ tags. Thus, tags that were formerly placed in your site’s source code are now all concentrated and managed in the same place – the container – for more **effective control** and **faster deployment**.

Note: in order to satisfy operational and organisational requirements or solve performance issues, you may have to use **multiple containers** for your site.
