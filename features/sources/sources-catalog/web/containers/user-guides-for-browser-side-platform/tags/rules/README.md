# Rules

The “**RULES**” step allows you to create your tag activation rules.

You can manage how your tags and events are called by using the tabs displayed in the left menu:

* The “**Summary**” tab provides you with an overview of the created rules per tag and event.
* The “**Triggers**” tab allow you to create triggers for your tags.\
  **Triggers** are rules allowing to execute tags on different conditions: container loaded, DOM Ready, clicks, form submissions, scroll and custom events.
* The “**Perimeters**” tab allows you to create perimeters for your tags.\
  **Perimeters** are the page types for which you want to activate your tags (for example: the homepage, “my account” page, product page, etc.).
* The “**Constraints**” tab allows you to create constraints for your tags and events.\
  **Constraints** are rules based on criteria other than the page type (for example: rules based on visitor status, the type of browser or device, etc.)\
  Note: You must use **constraints** if you want to create a **rule** for an **event**.
* The “**Deduplication**” tab allows you to implement deduplication rules for your tags.
* The "**Privacy Banners Constraints**" tab allows you to setup rules for display your privacy banners
