Data is collected by the “Commanders Act – Reporting Deduplication v1.2” tag.

**Interface Description**

Calendar

The calendar allows you to select a period of time to display deduplicated tag calls. There are eight predefined periods (_Yesterday, Last Week, Last 30 days, Last Month, Last Quarter, Month-to-Date, Quarter-to-Date, Year-To-Date_) and you can customize the period you wish to see tag calls for. You also have the possibility to compare periods to have a clearer vision of the way tags’ performance has evolved from one period to another.
