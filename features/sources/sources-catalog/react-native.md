# React native

## React native

We currently offer a bridge for ReactNative! It's compatible with iOS & Android.

Mobile developpers can follow our dedicated documentation

[https://github.com/CommandersAct/TCDemoReactNative](https://github.com/CommandersAct/TCDemoReactNative)

## Send Server -Side events:

To send events to Commanders Act you need a Source Key. To get it, you can use the dedicated Source on our platform.

Once your Source is called in your mobile app, you will obtain information about what is collected and the health of the implementation.&#x20;

This should be quite easy and straightforward now!
