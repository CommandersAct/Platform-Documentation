## I cannot see my console.log, why ?&#x20;

When you write a `console.log` within a tag to check if a tag is correctly triggered of to check a value, for example like this :&#x20;

When a new container version is generated, it re-writes the `console.log` as `tC.log`

To be able to read these `tC.log` you need to add this cookie within you browser :&#x20;
