# Common Container Strategies

A Container Strategy is the layout of the Web Container of a site. Following you will find recommended Container Strategies for common types of websites and businesses.

## Ecommerce

Ecommerce websites require a mix of personalization, analytics and conversion Tags. To optimise website performance it is recommended to use three Containers.

| Container        | Type     | Placement                  | Tags                            |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Head Container   | `<head>` | All pages                  | A/B-testing and personalization |
| Body Container   | `<body>` | All pages or catalog pages | Analytics and tracking          |
| Funnel Container | `<body>` | Funnel pages               | Conversion                      |

With this setup it is possible to avoid conversion Tag JavaScript snippets on catalog pagesâ€”this results in smaller Container file sizes and therefore quicker loading times for SEO relevant catalog pages.

## Publisher

Publisher websites primarily require analytics Tags. Therefore it is recommended to only use one Container.

| Container      | Type     | Placement                  | Tags                   |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Body Container | `<body>` | All pages or catalog pages | Analytics and tracking |

Using one `<body>` Container helps to have minimal impact on the page loading time, which is crucial for SEO of Content pages like news articles.&#x20;

In case A/B-testing and personalization Tags are used, the additional implementation of a `<head>` Container is recommended.
