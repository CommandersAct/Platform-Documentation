# tC.\* attributes and methods

_“tC.” methods are **namespaced\*** . They come in handy when needing to perform technically advanced actions such as printing the array of launched tags within a container into the browser’s console. Please note that these functions’ availability and behavior depend on several elements like your container configuration, among others. Simply type “tC.” into your browser’s console and the list of available functions on a given site and for a given container will appear._

_\* “**namespacing** is a technique employed to avoid collisions with other objects or variables in the global **namespace**. They’re also extremely useful for helping organize blocks of functionality in your application into easily manageable groups that can be uniquely identified.”_
