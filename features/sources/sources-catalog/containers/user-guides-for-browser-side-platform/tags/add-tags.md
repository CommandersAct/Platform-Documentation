# Add tags

### From the select step

The first step of the deployment process “**SELECT**” displays the tags present in your container and allows you to add new ones.

The main area of the “**SELECT**” interface displays all the tags already present in your container. Each block represents one tag: You can edit or delete your tag by clicking on the respective icons in the block.

You can search for a previously added tag by solution name using the “All vendors” filter in the drop-down menu or by searching for the tag name via the search box:
