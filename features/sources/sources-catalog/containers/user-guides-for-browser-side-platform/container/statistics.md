These statistics allow you to monitor container calls, view important information and make sure they continue to be called on your site.

You can find your container list on the left side of the “**Container firing**” interface.

Click  a container’s name to see its statistics: the deployed version number, the live version number, the last modification date and the tags’ default expiration period.

You can also display each container’s call statistics. These statistics are divided into four time periods: last day, last 7 days, last 30 days, and last year. Pass the pointer along the curve to see display detailed statistics.
