# Hosting

### Hosting types

We offer two ways for your container's hosting:

* Via our **CDN** (Content Delivery Network): provides you a total autonomous deployment. Our CDN is having a 99.9% of SLA
* Via your siteâ€™s **web servers**, managed by your IT department or outside technical provider. With this hosting option, you can choose a **synchronization method** (automatic or manual) for transmitting the modifications made for your site in the Commanders Act interface.\
  \
  In all cases : for a new workspace, you will be must to configure the connector on the platform. Use the menu Administration => Connector Credentials to add a new connector

If destinations from other sites use this identifier, they too will no longer work.

In case this login is currently used by at least one destination, our interface will display a list of the concerned destination(s) (only for the current site, it may affect some destinations on other sites)&#x20;
