# Mapping and Properties transformation

## Transform data before it gets to the destination.

In some case, you would need, for a specific destination, to transform your event before it is sent to the destination.\
\
_Properties transformation_ support currently renaming or deleting properties.

Enter on the left the property name you want to add or delete. Then enter on the right the property name to map (or leave empty to remove the property)

## Smart mapping

{% hint style="info" %}
Deployment in progress for all destinations
{% endhint %}

The smart mapping feature shows the mapping between standard events/properties and destination partner properties.

Ex: Standard property: value â‡’ Partner property: revenue

If needed, you can modify this mapping, with custom properties for example.
