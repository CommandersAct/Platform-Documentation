# Criteo (audiences)

[Criteo](https://www.criteo.com/) is an advertising company that provides online display advertisements, especially for retargeting campaigns.

Create a segment on DataCommander to build your audience. Then, you can push this audience to Criteo through our connector Criteo (audiences).

You need first to accept a consent link send by our consultants. This link is needed to authorize our DataCommander Criteo App to have access to your Criteo account to push audiences.

Then you can configure the connector, select the segment you created just before and simply enter your **Criteo Advertiser ID** (you can find it on your Criteo account).

Click on SAVE and it will automatically create a new audience (user list) on Criteo side.
