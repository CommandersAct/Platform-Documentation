# Microsoft Advertising Universal Event Tracking

[Microsoft Advertising](https://ads.microsoft.com) (formerly Bing Ads, Microsoft adCenter and MSN adCenter) is an online advertising platform developed by Microsoft. Using this destination, you can leverage UET framework to send events via server-side.

## Key features

The Microsoft Advertising Universal Event Tracking destination provides the following key features:

* **Events structure**: our [Events reference](https://community.commandersact.com/platform-x/developers/tracking/events-reference) model covers Microsoft events, meaning that your data is properly bridged to the expected fields in an optimized way.
* **Prebuilt mappings**: data mapping for event-based destinations happens automatically, which simplifies user inputs.
* **Smart mapping**: data mapping can be readjusted using your datalayer defined fields.&#x20;
* **Support for multi-item data**: information included in the [item](https://community.commandersact.com/platform-x/developers/tracking/events-reference#item) array is dispatched to Microsoft.
