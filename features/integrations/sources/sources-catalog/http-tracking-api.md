# HTTP tracking API source

The HTTP Tracking API lets you record data from any website or application. Requests are routed to our servers, and your data is routed to any destination you desire.

## Setup

### Headers

#### Authentication

Authenticate to the Tracking API by sending your projectâ€™s **Source Key** along with a request in the headers like so: `Authorization: Bearer NJtcKaoCYu...mGZDxRgMBMUw==`

#### Content-Type <a href="#content-type" id="content-type"></a>

To send data to our HTTP API, a content-type header must be set to `'application/json'`.

### Errors

We presently return a 200 response for all API requests, thus debugging should be done using the platform interface or our [config API](../../../../developers/config-api.md) (event inspector or event delivery API). The sole exception is that if the request is too large or the JSON is invalid, it will return a 400.

### Rate limit

There is no real rate limit above which the system will discard your data. But if you need to import at a rate faster than **500 requests per second**, please [contact us](mailto:support@commandersact.com) beforehand.

## Event API <a href="#track" id="track"></a>

You may use the event API to capture the actions that your users perform. Every action results in what is known as an "event," which have associated properties.&#x20;

You should keep track of activities that are indications of your app's performance, such as Signed Up, Item Purchased, and Article Bookmarked. To begin, we recommend tracking only a few key events. More may easily be added later!

Example `event` call:

```c
POST  https://api.commander1.com/v2/{siteId}/events
```

```json
{
  "event": "search",
  "eventId": "202110130000000000"
  "properties": {
      "search_term": "t-shirts", 
      "user": {
          "id": "12345",
          "email":"toto@domain.fr",
          "consent_categories": [1,3]
      }
  },
  "device": {
   "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2490.86 Safari/537.36",
    "ip": "108.0.78.21", 
    "cookies":"fbp=123; fbc=456; _ga=GA1.3.593276215.1565602323"
 },
 "eventTimestamp": "1639044446636"

}
```

## User API

User API let's you update/delete/create users in the database. Find details on [User API spec](https://community.commandersact.com/datacommander/api/users).

## Product API
