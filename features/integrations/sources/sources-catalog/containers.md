# Web container

A web container is the browser-side component of _Commanders Act_ Enterprise Tag Management system.\
It is composed of a set of browser-side tags, rules, triggers and enriched web data layer. It is represented by a container javascript file that is put on each pages of your website.\
For information about how users setup and maintain containers, see the [dedicated Web container guide](https://community.commandersact.com/web-container/).

## Connect serverside destinations to a web container <a href="#onetag" id="onetag"></a>

Sending data from your web container to serverside destinations offers a lot of advantages (web performance, security, data accuracy/quality, etc.)

To start sending data, there is only one easy step to follow : adding the _Commanders Act_ **One Tag**.

> The last tag that ~~you~~ will ever setup.

The _One Tag_ allows you to send all your events to the Commanders Act platform in a normalized way, and once and for all, to benefit from all the serverside advantages that offer the platform.
