# Live Event Inspector

Live event inspector is a great way to visualize in real-time all your incoming events, coming from a specific source (tab Event Inspector when you click on a source) or coming from all sources (Live Events Inspector link in Sources menu).

It is the easiest way to help you to debug what is received, you can check all properties and filter on specific events or properties.
