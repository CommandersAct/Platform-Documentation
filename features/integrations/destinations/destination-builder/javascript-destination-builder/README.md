# Javascript destination builder

For more advanced users, we propose to create custom destinations using server-side **javascript** (aka Node.js), but with an **easy and simplified** subset of Node.js : the _**Javascript Sandbox**_.

## Javascript Sandbox

Sandboxed JavaScript is a simplified Javascript that allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript logic from your custom destination securely and easily (no need to learn Node.js or to understand the async/await syntax)

This simplified Javascript is based on [helpers](serverside-js-helpers.md), set of methods that allow you to easily and quickly process and send your data.

{% hint style="info" %}
The technology for destination's template javascript sandbox in the platform is, to a large extent, compatible with Google Tag manager templates. \
In most cases, templates written for GTM run in Commanders'act with no (or few) changes
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also import templates created on GTM inside your catalog in a few clics with a 100% no-code experience.
