# Destination builder

If you want to send data to a destination that is not listed in our [destination's catalog](../destinations-catalog/), you can open a destination request, or you can write your own destination.&#x20;

The destination builder allows you to create your own custom destination, either with a _no-code_ approach (Webhook, FTP, API) or with a _javascript sandbox _aproach :

* Webhook/API destination builder
* FTP destination builder
* [JavaScript destination builder](javascript-destination-builder/) (JS sandbox)

## Create and publish a destination

When you publish your work in the destination builder, your destination wil be visible for your team in the destination catalog beside other destinations.

In the destination builder interface, you will be able to set:

* Information about the destination (label, logo, category)
* Destination settings, i.e. questions that will be asked to the user that will add this destination (e.g. token, account id, options ...)
* Connector technical options (url, method, etc.) or JavaScript code

Your destination can also be hosted on Github and automatically imported to facilitate updates on your side.
