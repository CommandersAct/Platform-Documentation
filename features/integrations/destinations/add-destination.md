# Destinations overview

Find here the full list of destinations already configured.

You can search a destination by name and filter on environment (production or staging), status (active or inactive) and per sources (mobile, web...).

3 tables are available: Cloud Mode, Audience and Raw Data.

### Cloud Mode

It refers to live destinations, through API, destinations that run in real-time. It pushes events (purchases, page views...).

### Audience

It refers to live destinations (API) that push users through segments.&#x20;

### Raw Data

It refers to scheduled destinations, through file exchange like FTP, S3 or Cloud Storage.

## Trend and Health

The trend represents the evolution of number of events pushed to the destination on the last month (maximum data retention period).

Health allow to quickly visualize the status of the destination, if everything is well sent (sunny) or not (stormy) on the last hour.\
