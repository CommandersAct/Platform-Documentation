# Destinations overview

Find here the full list of destinations already configured.

You can search a destination by name and filter on environment (production or staging), status (active or inactive) and per sources (mobile, web...).

Two tables are available: Cloud Mode and Audience.

### Cloud Mode

It refers to live destinations, through API, destinations that run in real-time.

The trend represents the evolution of number of events pushed to the destination on the last month (maximum data retention period).
