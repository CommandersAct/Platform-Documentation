# Normalized datalayer

{% hint style="warning" %}
Documentation in progress
{% endhint %}

In the _Normalized datalayer_ interface, you will be able to define the schema of your data.

Adding **event specifications** allows you to define the payload and what is expected, so that you can see if the data is meeting those specifications, in case there are any errors.

Then, in the [Source data quality](data-quality.md) view, you are able to see the summary of all specification violations, so that you fix it at your source or with the live [Data Cleansing](data-cleansing/) feature

![Write your event specifications](<../../.gitbook/assets/Normalized Datalayer \[IN PROGRESS] - Tab universes.png>)

You can choose to add a [standard event](../../developers/tracking/events-reference/) (from the event catalog) or a custom specification.

The schema of standard events is already defined, but you can modify it by adding more properties (standard or custom properties).
