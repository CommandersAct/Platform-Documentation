# Realtime Cookie Scanner

### 1. Introduction

The **Realtime Cookie Scanner (RCS)** is Commanders Act‚Äôs next-generation module for **continuous, intelligent, and real-world monitoring** of cookies and client-side storage (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, etc.).

Unlike crawler-based scanners that simulate visits with bots, the RCS observes **you real user sessions** ‚Äî across all countries, devices, browsers, and contexts ‚Äî providing a **complete, live picture** of what actually happens in your users‚Äô browsers.

Whether a cookie appears only for **specific users, browsers, countries, forgotten landing pages, or A/B test variants**, RCS detects it.\
No missed edge cases, no blind spots, no delayed snapshots.

***

### 2. Typical Use Cases

RCS provides Privacy, Marketing, and Technical teams with **instant, exhaustive, and actionable visibility** over every cookie and storage item.

**Common use cases include:**

* **Continuous CNIL / GDPR compliance monitoring**\
  Detect any cookie deposited before consent and stay compliant in real time.
* **Instant audit after container or tag deployment**\
  Ensure new releases haven‚Äôt introduced unauthorized cookies.
* **Proactive detection of new or undeclared partners**\
  Identify scripts depositing unexpected cookies.
* **Automatic multilingual cookie policy publication**\
  Generate and publish an auto-translated cookie table that stays up to date.
* **Post-release monitoring during redesigns or migrations**\
  Detect regressions or compliance issues immediately.

### 4. Setup and Configuration

Implementation is instant.

Your Commanders Act consultant or support simply activates RCS in the Backoffice.\
Once enabled, your Web Container injects the JS scanner and starts data collection.

> No scenarios to script, no login management, no maintenance.

RCS works immediately on real traffic ‚Äî including logged-in or restricted pages.

> üí° **Compatibility** : RCS is independent of the Commanders Act CMP or TMS and can be used with any CMP vendors or TMS vendors (GTM, etc.)

***

### 6. Cookie Notice Manager

The **Cookie Notice Manager** is the evolution of the legacy Cookie Scanner interface, now part of RCS.\
It lets you review, edit, and publish your cookie information.

#### Manage Cookie Information

Cookies are organized into three lists :

1. **New** ‚Äì recently detected, unreviewed.
2. **Active** ‚Äì validated, shown on the notice.
3. **Ignored** ‚Äì internal cookies, hidden from public view.

Each entry can be edited (‚úé) to adjust vendor, category, storage type, domain, duration, and description.\
You can also add custom cookies or activate/deactivate existing ones.

> Keep internal cookies in _Ignored_ to prevent reappearance after future scans.

#### Custom Fields & Filters

* Add custom fields via Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) to store extra info.
* Filter by host, language, storage type, or 3rd-party domain.
* A frequency slider hides rare cookies (< 5 % by default).

### 7. Manage Cookie Notice

`Health > Realtime Cookie Scanner > Cookie Notice Manager > DEPLOY (Tab)`

The **DEPLOY** tab is used to install, create, and publish the cookie notice on your website.\
It shows all existing notice versions and their status.

#### Install Cookie Notice

Once the cookie information is set up in the **EDIT** tab, you can install the cookie notice in three formats :

**1. JavaScript Snippet**

Paste the JavaScript snippet on your legal page to automatically generate and display the cookie list table.

**2. HTML Table (recommended)**

The HTML table is the recommended installation method for a dynamic cookie notice.\
Create a placeholder `<div>` in your CMS and use the tag template ‚ÄúTRUST | Install Cookie Notice‚Äù in your Web Container.\
Both must share the same ID (e.g. `ca-slot--cookie-notice`).

**Endpoint of the HTML file :**

```
https://cdn.tagcommander.com/cookie-scanner/<site_id>/v1/cookies-<language_code>.html
```

* **site\_id** = your Commanders Act site ID (e.g. 1234)
* **language\_code** = language of the cookie notice (default = `en`)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The HTML table uses accessible semantic markup and inherits your site‚Äôs CSS.\
> You can fully customize its style with your own stylesheet.

**3. JSON API**

For advanced or custom use cases, the JSON API returns the cookie information in a structured format that can be used in web apps or native apps.

**Endpoint of the JSON file :**

```
https://cdn.tagcommander.com/cookie-scanner/<site_id>/v1/cookies-<language_code>.json
```

* **site\_id** = your Commanders Act site ID
* **language\_code** = language code (e.g. `fr`, `en`)

{% hint style="info" %}
By default all cookies are listed but it is also possible to manage one cookie notice per website
{% endhint %}

***

#### Create a New Version

Click **NEW VERSION** to generate a new cookie notice based on the current Active cookies.\
You can add an internal comment to describe the changes.

#### Preview a Version

Preview does not apply your site styling.

#### Export a Version

Click the **Download icon (‚¨áÔ∏è)** to export all localizations in `HTML`, `JSON`, `CSV`, or `XLSX`.\
Each language is included as a separate file (or tab in XLSX).

#### Deploy a Version

You can also roll back to a previous version if needed.
