# Dashboards

The default dashboards provide real time figures about your siteâ€™s **visitors** (returning versus new, traffic, source of traffic) and **conversions**, allowing you to create more efficient segments and optimize results very quickly.

The period of analysis reflected in the dashboards consists of the last **24 hours**. All indicators are updated every **five seconds.**
