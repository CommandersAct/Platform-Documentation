## Creating a new user

_Note: only an administrator can create a new user._

![](../.gitbook/assets/UM\_3\[1].png)

3/ Fill in all required information about the new user:

(A) The account(s) you wish to grant access to

(B) User Roles. You can choose between 5 built-in roles:

* **Read only**: Users can visualize all of the interface’s elements but do not have the possibility to perform any action.
* **Marketing**: This role was conceived for users that do not wish to interact with the advanced technical elements of the interface. “Marketing” rights do not allow a user to create or edit containers, or to modify tags’ JavaScript code.
* **Technical**: This role provides access to every feature within the interface, except for a few advanced options that are available to account administrators only (please refer to the “Administrator” role to know more).
* **Custom**: “Custom” rights provide access to very specific parts of the interface, depending on your needs. For more information please refer to the “Modifying/customizing user rights” article.
* **Administrator**: The Administrator has access to every feature in the user interface and can create new users as well. Advanced options are only made available for administrators: renaming containers, creating “commander1.com” subdomains, connector setup…
* **Privacy manager**: The Administrator for the privacy module only.
* **Privacy technical**: This role gives access to the privacy module's features except for the options section.

If you created custom roles in the “profile management” tab (please refer to the “Creating User Profiles” article) , they will also be available from the “Role” dropdown menu.

Please note: If you select multiple sites (A), only user profiles shared by all these sites will be available from the “Role” dropdown menus.

(C) User type. You can choose between 3 types of user types:

* End user: clients
* Technology partner of an end customer: tag editors
* Service provider of an end customer: agencies working for end users

(D) Language. Note: at present the interface is only available in English and French.

(E) User Email. If the user is already present in Commanders Act’s database, the email, name and surname fields will automatically be filled in. We do not recommend giving access to generic email addresses: it could affect tracking of user actions within the interface and jeopardize security in case employees leave your company.

(F) User name and surname.

(G) You can also add/change account settings by clicking the “+” button.
