# On-Premise Proxy

The On-Premise Proxy is a feature that orchestrates the communication between your website/app and the Commanders Act platform. A proxy is a sort of intermediary, routing information back and forth between two pointsâ€”in this case, your website or app and Commanders Act.

The On-Premise Proxy is designed to be installed by your IT team on your own servers. This allows for control and flexibility in managing the data flow between your system and Commanders Act.

For the installation and technical details, your DevOps team can refer to the technical documentation available at the following link:
