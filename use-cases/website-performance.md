# Website performance

A Website’s performance is key to **SEO** and **user experience** and by extension on the **bounce rate** and **conversion rate.**\
****It has long been proven that the amount of client-side tags used on websites has an important impact on loading time and conversion rate.

In this context, tags’ **performance** has become a **strategic** matter and Commanders Act provides two ways to work on this topic:

1. **TagPerformance** feature, to analyse the impact of your tags
2. **Server-side** feature, to take actions to minimize impact

## **TagPerformance**

_**TagPerformance** _ module offers the possibility to measure your site’s performance based on the tags that are placed on it. It acts as a complementary tool to those used by IT departments to measure loading times of websites’ key elements (images, CSS …)

TagPerformance’s main features include:

* A measuring tag executed on the end client’s browser and not by a crawler.
* Analysis of the START RENDER, DOM READY and DOM LOADED events to measure impacts on performance.
* Visualization of significant variations in tags and page types, free from the noise resulting from the analysis of micro-variations.
* Information on loading times of a specific tag in relation with the average loading times of other solutions
* Data segmentation to focus on a particular segment: container, page type (product, home page...), device (mobile, tablet, Desktop), OS and browser.\

## Server-side

Switching from client-side tags to server-side destination solutions can have a significant impact on your website performance and conversion rate. While client-side tags have served us well in the past, they can also have a negative impact on website performance. These tags are placed directly on your website and are used to gather data and send it to third-party services. However, they slow down the loading time of your website and increase the risk of errors and data loss, as they rely on the user's browser to execute correctly.

On the other hand, server-side destination do not require any additional code to be placed on your website. Instead, processing and sending of the data is done directly from the server to the destination service. This means that server-side destination solutions do not impact your website's performance compare to client-side tags.

In addition to improving website performance, server-side destination solutions can also help to improve your conversion rate in other ways. This is because they offer a more reliable and accurate way to track and measure data, which can help you to make more informed decisions about your marketing and sales efforts.
