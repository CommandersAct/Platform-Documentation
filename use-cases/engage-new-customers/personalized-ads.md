## Use case setup

Step 1: create a segment, like for example with customers who saw your latest product but didnâ€™t buy on the last 2 days (not online, not in shops)

Step 2: create a stream to push your segment to partners like Facebook, Google, Criteoâ€¦

Step 3: on our partnersâ€™ platform, create relevant and personalized ads and activate it for the audience previously sent to the partner you selected.

**Quick Tip**:

Use our **Control Group feature** to measure results with the comparison of conversion uplift between the exposed population and the control group

## Exclude audience

**Stop exposing** a specific audience to a campaign.

Customers who just bought, lost customersâ€¦ donâ€™t expose them anymore and avoid spending too much money for customers who are not interested anymore. Moreover, manage the exposure capping.

For example, you want to target customers who saw a specific product but didn't buy. But you don't want to target users who just bought this specific product offline, in your shops. Simply create 2 segments, push them to the partner and use one for targeting and one for exclusion.
