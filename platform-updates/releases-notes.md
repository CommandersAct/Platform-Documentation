Our Cookie Scanner now delivers an unmatched user experience, combining the most exhaustive cookie capture on the market with powerful enhancements for usability and insight. Already leveraging data from tens of thousands of real users to capture a truly comprehensive view of cookies—something no virtual crawler can match—this update automatically filters out rare and irrelevant cookies, while adding advanced investigation and filtering capabilities for a more streamlined analysis.

Each log includes detailed information, including the originating events, status, errors, etc. setting a new standard in data transparency and control.

* **Full Log Export to SFTP**: This feature captures every outgoing request, exporting raw logs to an SFTP server for secure access and long-term storage.
