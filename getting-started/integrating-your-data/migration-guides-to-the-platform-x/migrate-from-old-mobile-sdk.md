# Migrate from old mobile sdk

To track mobile app on the new platform, you can either install our new SDK ([Android](../../../features/integrations/sources/sources-catalog/android.md) and [iOS](../../../features/integrations/sources/sources-catalog/ios.md)) or use our [HTTP tracking API](https://community.commandersact.com/platform-x/features/integrations/sources/sources-catalog/http-tracking-api).
