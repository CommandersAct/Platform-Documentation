### **Cookie first**:&#x20;

A first-party cookie is a cookie managed by the website owner to track users' activities and remember preferences. It is opposed to third-party cookies which are not owned by the website but partners (advertising partners, for example). Ad blockers and browsers are blocking more and more third-party cookies, that's why first-party cookie is a great workaround to keep a continuity on tracking users.

### **A-record**:&#x20;

It indicates the IP address of a given domain. 'A' for address, it is the most fundamental DNS record type (Domain Name System = website domain). By adding Commanders Act on your A-record, it allows Commanders Act to launch tags as first-party cookies, avoiding ad blockers and limitations regarding third-party cookies.
